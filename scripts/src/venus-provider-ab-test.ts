/**
 * Venus A/B test: Groq openai/gpt-oss-120b (CURRENT production model, 8K TPM)
 * vs Groq qwen/qwen3.6-27b (candidate, TPM unconfirmed — see below).
 *
 * IMPORTANT: gpt-oss-120b, not llama-3.3-70b-versatile or llama-4-scout, is
 * what Venus actually calls in production today — see
 * artifacts/api-server/src/routes/ai.ts,
 * .agents/memory/groq-model-deprecation-2026.md, and
 * .agents/memory/groq-scout-deprecation-2026-07.md. Groq deprecated
 * llama-3.3-70b-versatile on 2026-06-17 (migrated to gpt-oss-120b), then
 * separately deprecated llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct — announced
 * 2026-06-17, started hard-404ing in production on 2026-07-18 (migrated back
 * to gpt-oss-120b, the pre-Scout baseline). Testing against either deprecated
 * model here would compare against something you can no longer actually call.
 *
 * Why qwen/qwen3.6-27b specifically: it's Groq's own recommended alternative
 * to llama-4-scout (alongside gpt-oss-120b, which is already the current
 * baseline) per their deprecation notice. UNLIKE the original scout
 * migration, this repo does NOT yet have a confirmed Groq-specific TPM
 * figure for qwen3.6-27b — check Groq's /docs/rate-limits page directly
 * before trusting any number you find elsewhere, and treat this A/B test's
 * point of comparison as "is the reasoning quality at least as good", not
 * "is the TPM headroom worth it" until that number is actually confirmed.
 * Do not migrate production traffic off this script's output alone — also
 * hammer the candidate model with realistic back-to-back load and watch for
 * 429s before trusting a burst test's TPM ceiling.
 *
 * This is a standalone diagnostic script — NOT wired into the app, NOT
 * imported by any route. Run it manually, read the output, decide.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   GROQ_API_KEY=... pnpm tsx scripts/src/venus-provider-ab-test.ts
 *
 * What this does:
 *   1. Pulls the REAL VENUS_SYSTEM_PROMPT from the live groq.ts file (no
 *      copy-pasted/stale prompt — if you edit the prompt later, this script
 *      picks up the change automatically).
 *   2. Sends the same set of realistic founder queries + business context to
 *      both models on Groq, asking for the same JSON shape.
 *   3. Prints both raw outputs side by side so you can read and judge for
 *      yourself — this script does NOT auto-score or declare a winner.
 *      Quality judgment is a human call, not something to fake-quantify.
