// Until now, "a chat" only existed as a `ChatSession` object in the frontend's
// localStorage (see vera-nexus/src/lib/venusHistory.ts) — the server had no
// concept of it at all. Every /ai/* route was keyed on `sessionId` (now the
// Clerk userId), which is really "this whole person's account," not "this one
// conversation." That collapse is exactly why a per-chat Goal couldn't exist
// server-side: there was no row to hang it off.
//
// This table is that row. One per chat/thread, owned by a real user. The
// frontend's local chat list becomes a cache/mirror of these rows (and can
// eventually be dropped in favor of always reading from here), and
// venus_decisions / goals both reference chatId so a founder's decision
// history and roadmap can be scoped to "the Aurelian chat" vs "the Vera chat"
// instead of bleeding into one global per-user bucket.
