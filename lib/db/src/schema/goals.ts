// A Goal is the thing that turns a chat from "a place I asked Venus some
// questions" into "the thread I'm running this specific fight through" —
// e.g. Aurelian's chat carries "close Client X, demo scheduled [date]", the
// Vera chat carries its own build/launch goal. Set once per chat the way a
// Claude Project gets custom instructions: it frames every answer in that
// chat afterward, and every roadmap/decision card generated in that chat is
// implicitly a sub-task of it.
//
// One goal per chat at a time (chatId is unique) — a chat with no goal set
// is just an ordinary chat with no urgency/EV frame attached, which is the
// deliberate default. When a goal is done or no longer relevant the founder
// starts a NEW chat for the next goal; the old chat + its goal are kept,
// never overwritten, so history is retained exactly like switching Claude
// Projects rather than editing one in place.
//
// successMetric / valueInr / deadline are NOT optional embellishments — they
// are the only inputs that let Venus reason about urgency, expected value, or
// trade-offs at all. A goal without a concrete win condition, a rupee value,
// and a deadline is not reasoned about differently than an ordinary chat;
// the API layer should enforce all three are present before a goal is
// considered "set" rather than "draft."
