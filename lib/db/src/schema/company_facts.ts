// Replaces settings.venusBusinessContext's pipe-joined free-text blob with
// discrete, individually-supersedable facts. The blob approach only ever
// grows (saveStoredBusinessContext in ai.ts appends with " | ", never
// removes) so a founder correcting themselves ("actually we pivoted away
// from clinics") leaves the old claim sitting in the string forever, still
// getting fed into every future prompt alongside the correction — the exact
// "stale context" bug class already patched once by hand for goal state
// (see commit 0733bda). Structuring memory as rows with a `supersededBy`
// pointer fixes this at the data-model level instead of needing another
// one-off patch next time it recurs.
//
// Deliberately NOT a replacement for venusBusinessContext yet — that column
// stays as the fallback source ai.ts already reads (see
// getStoredBusinessContext), so nothing about the live chat path regresses.
// This table is additive: every context statement ai.ts already captures
// also gets logged here as its own fact, and future retrieval can prefer
// this structured source once there's a UI to manage/correct facts
// directly. Until then it accumulates for free from normal usage, same as
// venus_decisions does for Decision Memory.
